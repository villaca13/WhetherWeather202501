## Limitations and Future Work
### Limitations

- Currently, the website is only designed for desktops. 
- Database is on client side, localy stored and accessed. 
- Temperature unit is only celcius. 
- only 7 days forecast.
- only 9 cities available. 


### Future Work

- Implement an API to get live data and then add more cities to the website. 
- Implement fahrenheit (F) unit for temperature. 
- Improve the website layout and make it more responsive for different screen sizes. 
- Increase the forecast to 15 days ahead.
